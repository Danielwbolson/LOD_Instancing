# LOD_Instancing

This is a simulation in Unity showcasing level-of-detail, frustum culling, normal mapping, instanced rendering, 
all calculated in a compute shader.

This was a part of a published research paper featured here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794607
Here is our website if you would like a more visual interaction with our research: https://www.sculpting-vis.org/index.php/artifact-based-rendering/
I was 4th author and the results from the project were used extensively in our glyph rendering.
